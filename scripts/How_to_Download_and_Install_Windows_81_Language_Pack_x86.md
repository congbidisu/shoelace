You can either download the whole file as a ZIP archive or choose a specific language pack as a TORRENT file. The size of the ZIP archive is about 4.3 GB and the size of each TORRENT file is about 100-200 MB.

For example, "ar-SA" for Arabic (Saudi Arabia), "bg-BG" for Bulgarian (Bulgaria), "zh-CN" for Chinese (Simplified), etc. Each subfolder contains a file named "lp.cab" that is the actual language pack file.
 
## Step 3: Install the Language Pack
 
The final step is to install the language pack on your Windows 8.1 system. To do this:
 
1. Open Control Panel and go to Clock and Region > Language.
2. Click on Add a language and select the language that you want to install from the list.
3. Click on Options next to the language and then click on Download and install language pack.
4. Browse to the location where you mounted or extracted the language pack ISO file and select the "lp.cab" file that corresponds to your chosen language.
5. Wait for the installation to complete and then restart your computer.
